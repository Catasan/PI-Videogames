</p>

## Project Objectives:

- Create an App using React, Redux, Node and Sequelize.
- Build an SPA(Single Page Application) using React, Redux, Node and Sequelize.
- Learn and practice the Git workflow.

## AIM
- Create an app in which the user could see the different video games available and their most important information. The VG were brought from an external API. 

‚Ä¢ Some of the functionalities that I created were: 
<br/>
 ‚úÖ Searching different video games. 
<br/>
 ‚úÖ Filtering and sorting them.
 <br/>
 ‚úÖ Adding new video games.

‚Ä¢ I had to create different routes, components and a data base. I worked on the back-end and on the front-end as well.

üìçTechnologies that I used:

Back-End:
 <br/>
üî∏ NodeJS
 <br/>
üî∏ Express
 <br/>
üî∏ PostgresSQL

Front-End:
 <br/>
 üîπReact
  <br/>
 üîπRedux
  <br/>
 üîπCSS modules



### Only Endpoints/Flags that I could use

  - GET https://api.rawg.io/api/games
  - GET https://api.rawg.io/api/games?search={game}
  - GET https://api.rawg.io/api/genres
  - GET https://api.rawg.io/api/games/{id}

I was not allowed to use any external library for the styles design of the SPA.
